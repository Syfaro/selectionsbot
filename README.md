# selectionsbot

This bot allows for users to select items from a predefined list.

It was created for [a person on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/TelegramBots/comments/41ukw4/need_a_bot_similar_to_pollbot/) with a fairly specific use case of wanting to determine what items he needed to purchase for lunch for a group of users.

You may create a new selection list `/create`.
After creating a list, users may select an item with `/select`.

When you are done, you can run `/end` to stop users from selecting items.

`/count` lets you get total counts of each item, `/list` lets you see which users selected what item.
